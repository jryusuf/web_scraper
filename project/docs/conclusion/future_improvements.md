# Future Considerations & Potential Improvements

While the proposed design provides a robust foundation, several areas could be explored for future enhancement or optimization as the system matures and requirements evolve:

## Scraping & Anti-Scraping Enhancements

*   Implement more sophisticated browser fingerprinting evasion if targeting highly protected sites.
*   Explore AI/ML techniques for detecting website structure changes or identifying relevant data fields more dynamically.
*   Integrate dedicated CAPTCHA-solving services if manual rotation/avoidance proves insufficient for key targets.

## Data Processing & ML Integration

*   Develop and integrate more sophisticated Machine Learning models directly within the processing pipeline for extracting skills, categorizing roles, inferring seniority, or detecting salary information more accurately from job descriptions.
*   Implement more formal data quality validation rules and automated reporting on data quality metrics.

## Analytics & Data Storage Evolution

*   If analytical query performance over very large historical datasets becomes critical, establish an ETL/ELT process to load structured data into a dedicated **Data Warehouse** (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) optimized for OLAP workloads.
*   For large-scale ML training or cheaper long-term storage of processed data, consider utilizing a **Data Lake** architecture (e.g., storing data as Parquet files on S3 queried via Spark/Athena/Presto).
*   Implement a dedicated **Vector Database** or leverage `pgvector` more extensively if semantic search or similarity analysis based on embeddings becomes a core requirement.

## Operational & UI Improvements

*   Develop a more sophisticated user interface beyond the basic Django Admin for configuration management, job monitoring, and viewing results.
*   Implement more granular cost monitoring and reporting tied to specific scraping activities or sites.
*   Automate responses to certain alerts, such as temporarily pausing dispatch for sites exhibiting persistent high failure rates.

## Scope Expansion

*   Extend the framework to handle scraping of other relevant data types beyond job listings, such as company profiles, salary comparison data, or industry news.

These potential improvements represent directions for future development, building upon the scalable and maintainable core architecture proposed in this document. The initial focus remains on implementing the core system effectively to meet the primary challenge requirements.
