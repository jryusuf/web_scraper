## About This Site

This site hosts the comprehensive **design documentation** for a proposed **scalable data ingestion and processing system**. It details the architectural planning, technology choices, and operational strategies considered during its design phase.

This documentation aims to provide a clear and structured overview of the system's intended functionality, components, and underlying principles.

## Purpose of this Document

This site serves as the central reference for understanding the system's design, covering key aspects such as:

*   High-Level System Architecture
*   Core Technology Stack Selections
*   Data Flow and Component Interactions
*   Strategies for Handling Operational Challenges
*   Approaches to Scalability and Long-Term Efficiency

The focus is on presenting the design choices and their justifications clearly.

## How to Navigate This Documentation

This site is organized into logical sections detailing different facets of the proposed system.

**Please use the main navigation sidebar (usually on the left) or the top navigation tabs to explore:**

*   **Introduction:** Sets the context and outlines the core design principles guiding the architecture. *(Start here for background).*
*   **Architecture:** Provides the visual system overview and summarizes the chosen technologies.
*   **Data Ingestion (Scraping):** Details the strategy and implementation for acquiring data from external sources.
*   **Components & Workflow:** Describes the role and interaction of each individual system part.
*   **Data Processing & Analysis:** Outlines the plan for cleaning, standardizing, and utilizing the collected data.
*   **Operations & Scalability:** Covers deployment, monitoring, error handling, and efficiency strategies.
*   **Conclusion:** Summarizes the design and discusses potential future work.

Each section contains detailed explanations and diagrams where appropriate.
