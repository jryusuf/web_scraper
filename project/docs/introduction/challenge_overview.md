# Challenge Overview

This document outlines the proposed design for a system addressing the data engineering challenge presented. The core objective is to design and plan the implementation of a **scalable web scraping system** focused on collecting publicly available **job listing data** across various sources.

**Project Focus:**

The specific application domain for this design is the collection of job postings from:

*   Multiple **job boards** (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed, specific industry boards).
*   Various **industry sectors**.
*   Different **geographic locations/cities**.
*   A diverse set of **roles and job titles**.

**Core Tasks Addressed (Based on Exercise 1 & 2):**

1.  **Web Scraping Strategy & Implementation (Exercise 1):**
    *   Define an approach to identify relevant websites and scrape job data efficiently and ethically.
    *   Plan for handling common scraping challenges like dynamic content loading, pagination, rate limiting, and anti-scraping measures.
    *   Design a data model for storing the collected information (both raw and structured).
    *   Address data quality concerns like duplicates and missing values during collection.
    *   Select and justify appropriate programming languages, libraries, and frameworks (e.g., Python, Scrapy, Playwright, Requests).
    *   Outline storage solutions for raw scraped data (e.g., S3).

2.  **Data Processing & Optimization (Exercise 2):**
    *   Design a workflow to clean, standardize, and preprocess the scraped data for usability.
    *   Plan steps required if the data were to be used for machine learning applications (e.g., text processing, feature extraction).
    *   Outline strategies for optimizing the scraping and processing system for large-scale data collection and long-term efficiency (e.g., caching, parallel processing, monitoring).
    *   Define storage solutions for processed, structured data suitable for analysis (e.g., PostgreSQL).

The ultimate goal is to propose a robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture capable of collecting, processing, and storing valuable job market data for further analysis or application development.
