# Handling Anti-Scraping Measures

Many websites employ techniques to detect and block automated scraping.

## Core Strategies

### 1. Rotating User-Agents

*   **Problem:** Sending requests with a default library User-Agent (like `python-requests`) is an easy giveaway. Repeated requests with the *same* User-Agent can also be flagged.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Maintain a list of realistic, common browser User-Agent strings.
    *   Implement logic (e.g., middleware if using Scrapy, or direct logic in the worker's fetching function) to randomly select a User-Agent from the list for each request or session.
    *   Ensure the list is periodically updated with current browser versions.
    *   Libraries like `fake-useragent` can help generate realistic UAs.

### 2. Using Proxies (IP Rotation)

*   **Problem:** Making many requests from the same IP address is the most common reason for getting blocked or rate-limited.
*   **Solution:** Route outgoing requests through proxy servers.
    *   **Proxy Pool:** Maintain a pool of proxy IP addresses (sourced from commercial proxy providers or internal infrastructure). Providers often specialize (datacenter vs. residential IPs).
    *   **Rotation Logic:** Implement logic (middleware or within the worker) to select a different proxy IP for each request or after a certain number of requests/failures from a single IP.
    *   **Proxy Types:** Datacenter proxies are cheaper but easier to detect; Residential proxies are more expensive but harder to distinguish from real users. Choice depends on target site sensitivity and budget.
    *   **Management:** Handle proxy authentication, check proxy health (disable failing ones), manage session persistence if needed (sticky IPs). Commercial proxy services often handle much of this via API gateways.
*   **Implementation:** Configure the `requests` session or Playwright browser launch options to use the selected proxy for each request.

### 3. Realistic Request Headers

*   **Problem:** Missing or unusual HTTP headers can signal a bot.
*   **Solution:** Include standard browser headers like `Accept`, `Accept-Language`, `Accept-Encoding`, and sometimes `Referer` (set appropriately based on navigation flow). Ensure header order appears natural if possible, though often less critical than User-Agent and IP.

### 4. Mimicking Human Behavior (Delays & Timing)

*   **Problem:** Rapid-fire, perfectly timed requests are unnatural.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Implement politeness delays between requests (as covered in Rate Limiting).
    *   Introduce slight randomization (jitter) into delays.
    *   If using browser automation (Playwright), add small, randomized delays between actions (clicks, scrolls) where appropriate.

### 5. Handling JavaScript Challenges

*   **Problem:** Some sites use JavaScript execution, browser fingerprinting (checking fonts, screen resolution, plugins), or canvas fingerprinting to detect bots.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Using real browser automation (Playwright) inherently solves many basic JS execution challenges.
    *   Advanced fingerprinting may require specialized Playwright configurations (e.g., `playwright-stealth` adaptations) or using sophisticated commercial proxy/browser services that attempt to mask these attributes. This is complex and often site-specific.

## Gradual Approach

Start with basic politeness, User-Agent rotation, and good quality proxies. Introduce more complex techniques only if necessary based on monitoring data showing blocks or failures on specific target sites.
