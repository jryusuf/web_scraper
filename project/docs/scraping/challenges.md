# Handling Scraping Challenges Overview

Web scraping frequently encounters obstacles designed to prevent automated access or arising from website design. This section outlines strategies for common challenges.

Sub-sections cover specific tactics for:

*   **Rate Limiting & Politeness:** Avoiding overwhelming servers and handling "Too Many Requests" errors.
*   **Pagination & Infinite Scroll:** Navigating through multiple pages or dynamically loaded lists of results.
*   **Anti-Scraping Measures:** Dealing with mechanisms explicitly designed to detect and block scrapers (proxies, user-agents).
